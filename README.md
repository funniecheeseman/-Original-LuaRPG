# LuaRPG v2.1 ~ A Text-Based RPG Adventure!
***Created by funniecheeseman***

  Hey everyone! funniecheeseman here. I made this game back in around 2018 for fun to learn about repl.it, something outside of my comfort zone code-wise. It then became this really big project I've worked on for a really long time now that I just add to randomly, or even improve in other various ways! To get started, just head to a shell or terminal to enter commands and run the code from the main.lua.

Thank you so much for reading, and happy playing! :)
